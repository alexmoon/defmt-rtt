//! [`defmt`](https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt) global logger over RTT.
//!
//! NOTE when using this crate it's not possible to use (link to) the
//! `rtt-target` crate
//!
//! To use this crate, link to it by importing it somewhere in your project.
//!
//! ```
//! // src/main.rs or src/bin/my-app.rs
//! use defmt_rtt as _;
//! ```
//!
//! # Blocking/Non-blocking
//!
//! `probe-rs` puts RTT into blocking-mode, to avoid losing data.
//!
//! As an effect this implementation may block forever if `probe-rs` disconnects
//! at runtime. This is because the RTT buffer will fill up and writing will
//! eventually halt the program execution.
//!
//! `defmt::flush` would also block forever in that case.
//!
//! If losing data is not an concern you can disable blocking mode by enabling
//! the feature `disable-blocking-mode`
//!
//! # Critical section implementation
//!
//! This crate uses
//! [`critical-section`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section) to
//! ensure only one thread is writing to the buffer at a time. You must import a
//! crate that provides a `critical-section` implementation suitable for the
//! current target. See the `critical-section` README for details.
//!
//! For example, for single-core privileged-mode Cortex-M targets, you can add
//! the following to your Cargo.toml.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! cortex-m = { version = "0.7.6", features = ["critical-section-single-core"]}
//! ```
